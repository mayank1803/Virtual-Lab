        <b>Structure of P-N junction diode</b><br><br>
        <p>The diode is a device formed from a junction of n-type and p-type
            semiconductor material. The lead connected to the p-type material is called
            the anode and the lead connected to the n-type material is the cathode. In
            general, the cathode of a diode is marked by a solid line on the diode.</p>

        <b>Function of a P-N junction diode in Forward Bias </b><br><br>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The positive terminal of battery is connected to the P side(anode) and the
            negative terminal of battery is connected to the N side(cathode) of a diode, the holes in the p-type region
            and the electrons
            in the n-type region are pushed toward the junction and start to neutralize the depletion zone,
            reducing its width. The positive potential applied to the p-type material repels the holes,
            while the negative potential applied to the n-type material repels the electrons.
            The change in potential between the p side and the n side decreases or switches sign.
            With increasing forward-bias voltage, the depletion zone eventually becomes thin enough that the zone's
            electric field cannot
            counteract charge carrier motion across the p-n junction, which as a consequence reduces electrical
            resistance.
            The electrons that cross the p-n junction into the p-type material (or holes that cross into the n-type
            material)
            will diffuse into the nearby neutral region. The amount of minority diffusion in the near-neutral zones
            determines the amount
            of current that may flow through the diode.

        <b>Forward biased characteristics</b><br><br>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> <b>In forward biasing</b>, the positive
            terminal of battery is connected to the P side and the negative terminal of battery is connected to the N
            side of the diode.
            Diode will conduct in forward biasing because the forward biasing will decrease the
            depletion region width and overcome the barrier potential. In order to conduct, the
            forward biasing voltage should be greater than the barrier potential. During forward
            biasing the diode acts like a closed switch with a potential drop of nearly 0.6 V
            across it for a silicon diode.
            The forward and reverse bias characteristics of a silicon diode. From
            the graph, you may notice that the diode starts conducting when the forward bias
            voltage exceeds around 0.6 volts (for Si diode). This voltage is called cut-in voltage.</p>

        <b> Diode Equation</b><br><br>
        In the forward-biased and reversed-biased regions, the current (\(I_f\)), and the
        voltage (\(V_f\)), of a semiconductor diode are related by the diode equation:<br><br>
        $$I_f=I_s \times (exp^\frac{V_f}{n \times{V_T}}-1)$$<br><br>
        where,<br>

        \(I_s\) is reverse saturation current or leakage current,<br>

        \(I_f\) is current through the diode(forward current),<br>
        \(V_f\) is potential difference across the diode terminals(forward voltage)<br>
        \(V_T\) is thermal voltage, given by<br>
        $$V_T=\frac{k \times T}{q}$$
        <br><br>

        and<br>
        k is Boltzmann's constant = 1.38x10<sup>-23</sup> J /°Kelvin,<br>
        q is the electronic charge = 1.6x10<sup>-19</sup> joules/volt(Coulombs),<br>
        T is the absolute temperature in °Kelvin(°K = 273 + temperature in °C),<br>
        At room temperature (25 °C), the thermal voltage is about 25.7 mV,<br>
        n is an empirical constant between 0.5 and 2<br><br>
        The empirical constant, n, is a number that can vary according to the voltage and current levels. It depends on
        electron drift, diffusion, and carrier recombination in the depletion region.
        Among the quantities affecting the value of n are the diode manufacture,
        levels of doping and purity of materials. <br><br>
        If n=1, the value of \(\frac{k \times T}{q}\) is 26 mV at 25°C.<br>
        When n=2, the value of \(\frac{k \times T}{q}\) becomes 52 mV.

        For germanium diodes, n is usually considered to be close to 1. For silicon diodes, n is in the range of 1.3 to
        1.6.
        <br><br> <b>Note</b><br><br>
        <olstyle="margin-left: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>Ideal Diode Model:Diode is a simple switch that is either closed (conducting) or open (non conducting).
                Specifically, the diode is a short circuit, like a closed switch, when voltage is applied in the forward
                direction, and an open circuit,
                like an open switch, when the voltage is applied in the reverse direction.</li>
            <li>Offset Voltage Model:The offset voltage model adds the
                barrier potential to the ideal switch model. When the diode is forward biased it is equivalent to a
                closed switch in series with a small equivalent voltage source equal to the barrier potential (0.6 V for
                Silicon, 0.2 for germanium)
                with the positive side towards the anode. When the diode is reverse biased, it is equivalent to an open
                switch just as in the ideal model. </li>
            <li>Complete diode Model:It is the most accurate of the diode models.
                The Complete diode model of a diode consists of the barrier potential, the small forward dynamic
                resistance and the ideal diode. The resistor approximates the semiconductor resistance under forward
                bias.
                This diode model most accurately represents the true operating characteristics of the real diode.</li>
            <li>When a diode is reverse biased a leakage current flows through the device. This current can be
                effectively
                ignored as long as the reverse breakdown voltage of the diode is not exceeded.
                At potentials greater than the reverse breakdown voltage, charge is pulled through the p-n junction by
                the strong electric fields in the device and large reverse current flows. This usually destroys the
                device. There are special diodes that are designed to operate in breakdown.
                Such diodes are called zener diodes and used as voltage regulators.</li>
